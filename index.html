            <h4>Key features of JavaScript</h4>
            <p>Examples of popular websites and mobile applications developed with JavaScript include Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Here are a few reasons why you might consider learning this popular programming language: </p>
            <ul><li><p><b>JavaScript is fast.</b> It runs immediately within a web browser, reducing load time.</p></li></ul>
            <ul><li><p><b>JavaScript is easy.</b> Not only is JS a relatively easy language for programmers to learn, but its popularity also makes it easy to recognize and implement. </p></li></ul>
            <ul><li><p><b>JavaScript is interactive</b>. JS adds noticeable and responsive elements to websites such as zooming capabilities and dropdown menus. These elements enhance the user's experience and make JS an in-demand addition to website development.</p></li></ul>
            <ul><li><p><b>JavaScript gets along with other programming languages.</b> As a core web language, JS is closely aligned with CSS and HTML (other core languages used to build websites). It also has a variety of frameworks and libraries that programmers can learn to specialize their skills.</p></li></ul>
            <h3>2. HTML/CSS</h3>
